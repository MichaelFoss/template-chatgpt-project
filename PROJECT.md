# Project Overview

## Purpose

This repository is a Git-backed source-of-truth system for maintaining
long-term ChatGPT Project context.

The repository stores curated source documents, operational workflows,
project instructions, prompts, and supporting metadata in a structured,
deterministic format.

The goal is to:

- keep durable context out of transient chat history
- maintain explicit version control over uploaded ChatGPT context
- separate current curated knowledge from historical/raw material
- support reproducible ChatGPT Project refresh workflows
- make long-running ChatGPT Projects maintainable over time

## Repository Model

Git is the canonical source of truth.

The ChatGPT Project is treated as a runtime environment that consumes
curated uploaded files derived from this repository.

The repository intentionally distinguishes between:

- durable source documents
- prompts and operational workflows
- generated upload artifacts
- historical/archive material
- transient conversation history

## ChatGPT Project Setup

Use:

- `instructions/project-instructions.md` as ChatGPT Project
  Instructions.
- `dist/upload-instructions.md` as the operational upload checklist.
- `sources/index.md` to determine which source files are eligible for
  upload.
- generated files from `dist/uploads/` as the actual uploaded ChatGPT
  Project runtime sources.

Upload only curated source documents intended for runtime retrieval.

Do not upload repository maintenance files unless explicitly needed.

## Source Document Standards

Source documents should:

- remain retrieval-friendly
- contain durable factual context
- avoid unnecessary conversational prose
- clearly distinguish confirmed facts from uncertainty
- use consistent metadata/frontmatter
- remain reasonably scoped and maintainable

Files prefixed with `_` are considered stubs, templates, inactive
material, or non-runtime documents unless explicitly promoted.

## Build Model

The repository build process creates immutable ChatGPT upload
checkpoints.

Normal workflow:

```bash
yarn run check
git add .
git commit -m "Describe the source update"
yarn build
```

Then follow:

```text
dist/upload-instructions.md
```

A successful `yarn build`:

- requires a clean Git working tree
- must be run from the repository root
- creates a `build-YYYY-MM-DD-NNNN` Git tag when upload-impacting
  changes are detected
- skips rebuilding when `HEAD` already has a build tag
- skips build creation when no upload-impacting files changed
- copies changed uploadable source files into `dist/uploads/`
- appends build tags to generated upload filenames
- uses immutable generated upload filenames to preserve runtime
  provenance
- always copies project instructions into `dist/project-instructions.md`
  for paste-ready first-time setup and reference workflows
- writes operational upload instructions into
  `dist/upload-instructions.md`
- generates `dist/chatgpt-upload-bundle.md` for auditing, portability,
  and reference workflows

If no upload-impacting files changed since the prior build tag, no new
build tag is created. The project instructions artifact is still
regenerated so first-time ChatGPT Project creation always has a
paste-ready instructions file.

Generated upload filenames intentionally include the build tag where the
source file last changed.

Example generated upload filename:

```text
baseball-cards.build-2026-05-17-0003.md
```

Stable Git source filename:

```text
sources/baseball-cards.md
```

When updating uploaded ChatGPT Project source files:

1. delete the prior versioned uploaded file from the ChatGPT Project
2. upload the newly generated versioned file

To restore generated build artifacts without creating a new build tag:

```bash
yarn restore-build
```

The restore-build workflow:

- recreates generated upload artifacts from current repository state
- inspects existing `build-*` Git tags without creating new ones
- restores per-file build provenance in generated upload filenames
- recreates `dist/upload-instructions.md`
- recreates `dist/project-instructions.md`
- recreates `dist/chatgpt-upload-bundle.md`

## Default Upload Policy

Upload only current, curated source files.

Do not upload:

- archive material
- raw notes by default
- superseded summaries
- repository maintenance documentation
- prompts/workflow documents
- inactive `_`-prefixed files

unless explicitly required for the active ChatGPT workflow.

## Review Standard

Durable information discovered during conversations should eventually be
converted into source document updates rather than remaining only in
chat history.

When source documents change:

1. update the relevant source files
2. commit the changes to Git
3. run `yarn build`
4. follow `dist/upload-instructions.md`
5. refresh the ChatGPT Project runtime context as needed

## Long-Term Maintenance Model

Projects created from the template are intentionally independent.

The template repository is a starting point, not an inheritance model.

Template improvements may be manually copied or cherry-picked into
downstream projects when useful.

Downstream projects are expected to evolve independently over time.

The template-update helper does not special-case `instructions/`,
project-instruction artifacts, or `dist/`. It fetches the template
remote, cherry-picks the requested source commit, and records a ledger
entry in `template-updates.md`. Generated `dist/` artifacts remain
script-owned and ignored by Git, so this always-generated instructions
artifact should integrate through the build scripts rather than by
committing generated files.
